2. Write a C++ program to convert numbers into clock word time. For example:
5:00 Five o'clock
5:10 Ten minutes past five
5:15 Quarter past five
5:30 Half past five
5:45 Quarter to six
5:47 Thirteen minutes to six
Input from the keyboard two numbers: the hour in the range [1,12] and seconds in the range [0,59].
Error check (validate) inputs. Output to the screen the time represented, in clock words following the
sample above. Finally, the program should ask if the user wants to run the program again (Check case).
Refer to the sample output below.
Sample Run:
Hour and minute: 4 12
Time: Twelve minutes past four
Run Again (Y/N): y
Hour and minute: 1 0
Time: One o'clock
Run Again (Y/N): Y
Hour and minute: 6 37
Time: Twenty-three minutes to seven
Run Again (Y/N): Y
Hour and minute: 2 3
Time: Three minutes past two
Run Again (Y/N): n
Name the program: TimeWordsXX.cpp, where XX are your initials
